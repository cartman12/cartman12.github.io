[Public Transportation, Private cars, and CO2 Emission: The case of Europe, Turkey and Switzerland](https://medium.com/@mhd.ali.nasser/public-transportation-private-cars-and-co2-emission-the-case-of-europe-turkey-and-switzerland-d5d6aa6988f1)
This study takes a small dive into Europe's choice of transportation methods - exploring each country's preferred method of transport (Bus, train and cars), and the evolution of that preference over the past 26 years (the data starts in 1990 and ends at 2016). We will then take a look at Europe's CO2 emission data by country.
